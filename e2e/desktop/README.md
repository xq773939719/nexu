# Nexu Desktop E2E Automation

End-to-end test suite for the packaged desktop app. Dependencies are isolated and do not affect the main repo's `pnpm install`.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd e2e/desktop
npm install           # Install Playwright (one-time)
npm run download      # Download latest nightly DMG + ZIP (~500MB)
npm run test:smoke    # Run smoke to verify the basics
```

## Prerequisites

- macOS (ARM64 or x86_64)
- Node.js >= 22 (`nvm install 22`)

### macOS Permissions Setup

The test suite uses `osascript` to automatically dismiss quit dialogs and `screencapture` for screenshots. These require explicit macOS permissions.

**Accessibility** (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility):

| App to add | Why | How to add |
|------------|-----|------------|
| Terminal.app (or iTerm2) | Needed when running tests locally from Terminal | Should appear automatically on first run; toggle ON |
| `/usr/bin/osascript` | Needed for automated UI interaction (clicking quit dialog buttons) | Click `+`, press `Cmd+Shift+G`, type `/usr/bin/osascript`, add and toggle ON |
| GitHub Actions Runner | Needed for CI — the runner process must be able to interact with UI | Add the runner binary or its parent shell |

> **Note on SSH sessions**: macOS does not grant Accessibility permissions to processes spawned via SSH, even if `/usr/bin/osascript` is added. This is an OS-level limitation. Tests run via SSH will fall back to `kill -9` for app shutdown (functional but not graceful). Tests triggered via GitHub Actions runner (which runs in a GUI login session via LaunchAgent) do not have this limitation.

**Screen Recording** (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording):

| App to add | Why |
|------------|-----|
| Terminal.app (or iTerm2) | For `screencapture -v` system recording and `screencapture -x` failure screenshots |
| GitHub Actions Runner | Same, for CI runs |

> If Screen Recording permission is not granted, tests will still pass — recording will silently fail and screenshots may be blank, but no test will break because of it.

### First-time Setup Checklist

```bash
# 1. Install Node.js
nvm install 22

# 2. Install E2E dependencies
cd e2e/desktop
npm install

# 3. Grant macOS permissions (manual, one-time)
#    - System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility → add Terminal + /usr/bin/osascript
#    - System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording → add Terminal
#    (See tables above for details)

# 4. Download nightly artifacts
npm run download

# 5. Verify everything works
npm run test:smoke
```

## Test Modes

| Command | What it tests |
|---------|--------------|
| `npm run test:smoke` | DMG install → codesign verify → spctl Gatekeeper check → cold start → runtime health |
| `npm run test:login` | Smoke → click "Use Nexu Account" → browser OAuth → wait connected → workspace redirect → Agent running |
| `npm run test:model` | Smoke → fake provider setup → model A/B switch → verify runtime-model.json |
| `npm run test:update` | Smoke → version downgrade → local update feed → check + download + install |
| `npm run test:resilience` | Smoke → 5 edge-case scenarios (see details below) |
| `npm test` | All of the above (full) |
| `npm run cleanup` | Kill all Nexu processes, bootout launchd services, free ports |

## Testing Different Builds

### Nightly (default)

Use this path when you want to validate the latest published nightly desktop artifacts.

`npm run download` automatically selects the nightly `arm64` or `x64` artifacts for the current Mac.

```bash
npm run download && npm test
```

### Beta / Stable

Override download URLs via environment variables:

```bash
# Beta (Intel Mac example)
NEXU_DESKTOP_E2E_DMG_URL=https://desktop-releases.nexu.io/beta/x64/nexu-latest-beta-mac-x64.dmg \
NEXU_DESKTOP_E2E_ZIP_URL=https://desktop-releases.nexu.io/beta/x64/nexu-latest-beta-mac-x64.zip \
npm run download && npm test

# Stable (Apple Silicon example)
NEXU_DESKTOP_E2E_DMG_URL=https://desktop-releases.nexu.io/stable/arm64/nexu-latest-stable-mac-arm64.dmg \
NEXU_DESKTOP_E2E_ZIP_URL=https://desktop-releases.nexu.io/stable/arm64/nexu-latest-stable-mac-arm64.zip \
npm run download && npm test
```

### Local Builds (unsigned)

Use this path when you want to validate a desktop build produced from your local checkout instead of the published nightly artifacts.

Copy DMG and ZIP into `artifacts/` and skip signature checks:

```bash
# Build in the main repo (choose the variant matching your Mac)
pnpm dist:mac:unsigned:arm64
# or
pnpm dist:mac:unsigned:x64

# Copy to E2E artifacts
cp apps/desktop/release/*.dmg apps/desktop/release/*.zip e2e/desktop/artifacts/

# Run tests (skip codesign/spctl)
cd e2e/desktop
NEXU_DESKTOP_E2E_SKIP_CODESIGN=true npm run test:model
```

### Resilience Mode (Edge Cases)

`test:resilience` verifies the app's ability to recover from abnormal conditions:

| Scenario | What it simulates | Expected behavior |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Crash Recovery** | `kill -9` the Electron main process (Force Quit simulation) | launchd services survive; app attaches or rebuilds on restart |
| **Orphan Cleanup** | Kill Electron, leave controller/openclaw as orphan processes | App detects and cleans up orphans on restart, starts fresh |
| **Port Conflict** | Occupy port 50800 with a dummy listener before launching | App detects EADDRINUSE, picks an alternative port or exits gracefully |
| **Stale State** | Write a fake `runtime-ports.json` pointing to non-existent services | App detects stale session, ignores fake state, performs fresh start |
| **Double Launch** | Start a second instance while the app is already running | Second instance exits (single-instance lock), first instance unaffected |

### Login Mode Notes

`test:login` requires completing OAuth login in a browser:

1. On first run, the script opens a browser to the nexu.io login page
2. Complete login in the browser
3. The script detects login success automatically and continues
4. Login state is persisted in `.tmp/home/` and reused across runs
5. To force re-login, delete `.tmp/home/.nexu/`

## CI

GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/desktop-e2e.yml`

### Automatic Triggers

E2E runs automatically after builds, **without blocking** the build/release status:

| Trigger | When | What it tests |
|---------|------|---------------|
| `desktop-nightly.yml` | After nightly build completes | Downloads nightly → `model` mode |
| `desktop-release.yml` | After release publishes | Downloads matching channel (beta/stable) → `model` mode |
| Scheduled | Daily at 03:00 UTC (11:00 CST) | Downloads nightly → `model` mode |

Build/Release workflows **asynchronously dispatch** the E2E workflow. E2E success/failure does not affect the build/release green status.

### Manual Trigger

When triggering manually from the GitHub Actions page, three parameters are available:

| Parameter | Options | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Source** | `download` (default) / `build` | `download` fetches a published build; `build` checks out the current branch and builds unsigned locally |
| **Channel** | `nightly` (default) / `beta` / `stable` | Only applies to `download` source — selects which channel to fetch |
| **Mode** | `smoke` / `login` / `model` (default) / `update` / `resilience` / `full` | Which test scenarios to run |

#### Source = download (test published builds)

```
Trigger → download signed build for the selected channel → run E2E
```

Typical use case: verify a just-published nightly/beta/stable build works correctly.

#### Source = build (test current branch)

```
Trigger → checkout current branch → pnpm install → build unsigned → run E2E (skip codesign)
```

Typical use case: verify changes on a feature branch don't break the packaged app, without publishing first.

### Failure Diagnostics

On CI failure, `captures/` is automatically uploaded as a GitHub Actions artifact (retained for 14 days). Download from the Artifacts section of the Actions run page.

### Mac mini Self-hosted Runner Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:nexu-io/nexu.git ~/nexu
cd ~/nexu/e2e/desktop
npm install

# 2. Install GitHub Actions runner
mkdir -p ~/actions-runner && cd ~/actions-runner
# Download from: https://github.com/actions/runner/releases (macOS ARM64)
curl -fL -o actions-runner.tar.gz https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.324.0/actions-runner-osx-arm64-2.324.0.tar.gz
tar xzf actions-runner.tar.gz && rm actions-runner.tar.gz

# 3. Register runner (get token from repo Settings → Actions → Runners → New)
./config.sh --url https://github.com/nexu-io/nexu \
  --token <YOUR_TOKEN> \
  --name mac-mini-e2e \
  --labels self-hosted,macOS,ARM64 \
  --unattended

# 4. Install as user-level LaunchAgent (runs in GUI session, no sudo needed)
#    Create ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.actions-runner.plist with:
#      ProgramArguments: ~/actions-runner/run.sh
#      RunAtLoad: true
#      KeepAlive: true
#      PATH must include Node.js bin dir
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.actions-runner.plist

# 5. Grant macOS permissions (CRITICAL for CI)
#    System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility:
#      - /usr/bin/osascript (for quit dialog automation)
#      - The runner process or its parent shell
#    System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording:
#      - The runner process (for screencapture)
#
#    NOTE: The runner MUST run in a GUI login session (LaunchAgent, not LaunchDaemon)
#    for Accessibility permissions to work. SSH-spawned processes cannot use
#    Accessibility — this is a macOS security limitation.

# 6. Verify runner is online
gh api repos/nexu-io/nexu/actions/runners --jq '.runners[] | {name, status}'
```

## Diagnostics and Debugging

The test runner automatically captures diagnostics into `captures/`:

### Always Captured

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `captures/screen-recording.mov` | System-level full-screen recording (OS dialogs, browser login, quit prompts — all visible) |
| `captures/packaged-app.log` | Electron main process full log |
| `captures/packaged-logs/` | Desktop runtime logs |
| `captures/runtime-unit-logs/` | Per-unit logs (controller, openclaw) |
| `captures/codesign-verify.log` | codesign verification details |
| `captures/spctl-assess.log` | Gatekeeper assessment result |
| `captures/kill-all.log` | Process cleanup log |

### Captured at Test End

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `captures/state-snapshot/dot-nexu/config.json` | Nexu config (API keys redacted) |
| `captures/state-snapshot/openclaw-state/openclaw.json` | OpenClaw runtime config |
| `captures/state-snapshot/openclaw-state/nexu-runtime-model.json` | Currently selected model |
| `captures/state-snapshot/runtime-snapshot.txt` | Process list, port usage, launchd status, controller/openclaw health |

### Captured on Failure Only

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `captures/failure-screenshot.png` | System screenshot at the moment of failure |
| `captures/{scenario}-failure-screenshot.png` | Playwright screenshot of the webview page |
| `captures/{scenario}-failure-page.html` | Page HTML at failure time |

### How to Debug

1. **Watch the recording** — `screen-recording.mov` shows the entire test, including OS dialogs
2. **Check screenshots** — failure screenshots quickly reveal UI state
3. **Read packaged-app.log** — search for `error`, `fail`, `ERR_`
4. **Check state snapshot** — `runtime-snapshot.txt` shows who owns which port at failure time
5. **Check runtime-model.json** — for model switch failures, inspect `selectedModelRef`

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `NEXU_DESKTOP_E2E_DMG_URL` | nightly DMG for current Mac arch | DMG download URL |
| `NEXU_DESKTOP_E2E_ZIP_URL` | nightly ZIP for current Mac arch | ZIP download URL |
| `NEXU_DESKTOP_E2E_SKIP_CODESIGN` | `false` | Set to `true` to skip signature verification (for unsigned local builds) |
